It's time to start thinking deeply about your final map project for MAP673. Using the process covered in Module 05, the deliverable for this week will include three pieces:
1.	the map topic and/or geographic phenomena your map will explore
2.	an articulation of the map's objectives and user needs
3.	your data source and (at least a sample of) the data required to meet the map's objectives
Write thorough descriptions/answers to the following within some text-based format of your choice, and submit through your GitHub account.
Topic and/or geographic phenomena your map will explore
What are you mapping? *** I’m mapping ***

Briefly describe the topic and the geography the map intends to represent. Also, provide a tentative title (and possibly a subtitle) for you map. Remember that good titles, while being provocative and potentially fun, also tell a user three things: 1. what is being mapped, 2. where it's being mapped, and 3. when the phenomena occurred.
Map objectives and user needs
•	Begin by answer the question, "Why are you making this map?"
•	Consider your own positionality with respect to the map and tell us why you are making it and what you want to get out of it.
•	Create a brief user persona and tell us what this persona(s) will get out of the map. Why are they using it? How would you characterize this user in terms of their expertise and motivation (i.e., novice/public, average, expert/domain-specific)
•	Imagine a scenario about how the user may use the map. It need not cover all potential use case scenarios, but it should describe some potential action the user will engage in to meet their objective (i.e., filtering the data, searching for an address, changing the attribute through a dropdown menu)
Data source
This one is really important. Sometimes we have great goals and ideas for a map. But if we can't (somewhat easily) get the data ... the map is going nowhere. I need to see that you have access to the data, or at least some ugly data that we can consider strategies for refining and cleaning up.
Provide me with 1. your anticipated data source (URL, etc) and 2. a small sample of the data (e.g., CSV, GeoJSON, Shapefile, or within a database)
Part III. Anticipating your technology stack
While your answer to this question need not be definite at this point, briefly describe the "technology stack" you anticipate using for your final map. This should include:
•	data and information processing tools, web-based or desktop (i.e., QGIS, MapShaper)
•	the format you'll use to store your data (i.e., flat files such as CSV or GeoJSON, database technology such as CartoDB)
•	the JS libraries you anticipate using or need (include any relevant plugins)
•	other relevant web technologies you'll be using (i.e., HTML, CSS)
•	the hosting platform you intend to use to host your map (i.e., GitHub pages, your own web server)
Note: This is a draft of the information we'll want to include in your final map writeup. While informative to curious users of your map, it also looks good to employers and clients in terms of demonstrating your expertise in the world of open source web mapping!
